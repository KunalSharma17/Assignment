<p align="justify">Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside
 the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players – field players and a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect 
 the goal. He’s the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area. There are also 3 men which are not
 playing, these are the referees.<br><br>
 
 Personally I play football for both training and fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the technique, and moving on the pitch builds the 
 condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice feeling, what makes football a good game for minimizing the
 stress. It’s good to have an on-field idol, that you can watch to improve your skills. My idol is 'Cristiano Ronaldo’, because I love the way 
 he heads, shoots, sprints, celebrates, passes, and score goals. He is an awesome human being off the feild too. He dontes blood and plasma
 regularly, funds various charities, and also visits cancer patients.<br><br>
 
 While playing, you must remember that football is a team game. Individual actions may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure from the game
 when you remember about the teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is much more effective, and when there’s chemistry between the teammates, you can 
 beat stronger or even more skilled oponents. Football is based on teamwork and that’s the best part of it in my opinion.</p>
