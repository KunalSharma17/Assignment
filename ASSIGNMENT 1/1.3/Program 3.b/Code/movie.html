<h1 style="font-size: 40px"><b><center>5 Reasons Why Watching TV Can Be A Hobby</center></b></h1><br>
<ol class="a">
	<li>Watching TV is Fun and Interesting</li>
</ol>
	<p align="justify">One thing that all hobbies have in common is the ability to bring the fun to whoever is participating in them.
	Watching tv is no different. Television is meant to entertain and enjoy. If you’re going to take on a hobby,
	it might as well be something you like to do.</p><br>
	
<ol class="a" start="2">	
	<li>There’s Always a New Character to Analyze</li>
</ol>
	<p align="justify">One may argue that watching tv shouldn’t be considered a hobby because it isn’t stimulating. On the other hand,
	watching tv can be intellectually stimulating depending on how you look at it. There are so many different characters
	and storylines that are written in a variety of ways and you can’t help but to sometimes compare. New tv shows bring
	new characters to analyze in terms of character development, acting, and other variables. There are tons of different
	elements that go into the shows themselves like writing, producing, and casting and you get to inspect each one as
	you enjoy your favorite show.</p><br>

<ol class="a" start="3">
	<li>Watching TV Can Connect You To A Community For The Shows You Love</li>
</ol>
	<p align="justify">Everything that you can analyze within a show can be done yourself or within a community dedicated to
	discussing that show. There are a variety of forums and boards specifically made for television discussion. You can connect
	with other people who like to watch and discuss the same things you do. If you do not want to join a discussion board, you
	can also visit the comment section of Youtube. Fans from all over contribute their opinions and thoughts on shows, and the
	discussion just naturally happens when there are opposing opinions or agreements. These discussions between people who enjoy
	television illustrate that there is more to watching tv then just the act itself.</p><br>

<ol class="a" start="4">
	<li>Each Genre Brings Something Different</li>
</ol>
	<p align="justify">How many tv genres can you name?. There are sitcoms, action and adventure, teen drama, sci-fi, animation,
	reality television, and the list goes on and on. This list shows you that there are many directions you can go in when it
	comes to watching tv as a hobby. You don’t have to stick to one genre because there are so many to explore. Each genre also
	brings something different to the table. There are the differences in acting, characters, and storyline of course, but there
	are also different tropes and expectations. For example, with a comedy, you can usually expect a laugh track, an ensemble cast,
	and somewhat corny dialogue.</p><br>
	
<ol class="a" start="5">
	<li>Watching TV Can Lead You To Other Hobbies</li>
</ol>
	<p align="justify">Often when you become a fan of a show or you watch it regularly, its for a reason. Maybe you connected
	with a character or it could even be the creative production of the show. Whatever that love may be, it can connect you
	to other hobbies that relate to the show you watch like cosplay. Cosplaying is a performance art where people, also known
	as cosplayers, create their own costumes to replicate a character while sometimes acting in the same way as that character.
	You may even consider improv, screenwriting, voice acting, or acting as something to learn more about.<br><br>
	I for one 100% think that watching tv can be considered a hobby depending on what you put into it. Watching tv can be
	something that you do for entertainment, but it can also be something you connect with and find value in.</p>
